# Smart-Lock
Using Arduino Uno, Keypad, LCD and Servo Motor, we were able to build a smart lock that asks you to enter the password. If you enter the correct password the servo motor rotates 90 degrees to open the door. Otherwise, the door stays locked and the LCD gives you a "Wrong Password" message forcing you to wait for 10 seconds to try again.


# Note
You may include the keypad library as it maybe not built in Arduino IDE.
